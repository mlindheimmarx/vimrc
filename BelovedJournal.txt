2. Baby Suggs is saying that every house is haunted by some ghost, and that it is good that the ghost in their house is only a baby, or (it is implied) it could be much more malevolent. All of Suggs' children are "gone from her" (6), and so she encourages Sethe to be content with the three she has that are alive and not dwell on the baby's ghost. The significance of this quote is that it claims that a black man has suffered and died in every house in America, referring to both the slave trade and the struggles of post-slavery life.
