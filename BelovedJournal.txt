Questions:
    1. Paul D came back today--like a spirit drifting back to the world on wings of smoke--he remembers a time long past when I had done no horrors, had wrought no evil. He reminds me of that time, back in Sweet Home, that I do not recall without a kind of catalyst, yet just a look at him reminds me of Halle and the Garners. I don't know whether to welcome him or not: certainly he makes Denver distant, but he makes me feel young again. He chased away my beloved, I guess, literally and maybe symbolically. I want him to stay. He makes me a person and not an abomination.
    2. Baby Suggs is saying that every house is haunted by some ghost, and that it is good that the ghost in their house is only a baby, or (it is implied) it could be much more malevolent. All of Suggs' children are "gone from her" (6), and so she encourages Sethe to be content with the three she has that are alive and not dwell on the baby's ghost. The significance of this quote is that it claims that a black man has suffered and died in every house in America, referring to both the slave trade and the struggles of post-slavery life.
    3. Paul D and Sethe remember the conditions of Sweet Home. Although the slave-owners Mr. and Mrs. Garner seem reasonably kind, the six slaves who work there (Paul D Garner, Paul F Garner, Paul A Garner, Halle Suggs, and Sixo) do not. They apparently "[fucked] cows" and "[dreamt] of rape" (13). Sethe remembers boys "taking her milk" (19) while she had a nursing child, and when they were found out the schoolteacher whipped her so much that later it looks like a tree, and by the time of the main narrative she has lost all feeling in her back. Morrison gives us this information slowly for two reasons. First, it keeps the reader in suspense and thus increases the reader's investment in the book, but second, it parallels how Sethe's memory of Sweet Home is only accessible at certain times when a small thing reminds her.
    
Letter:
    I think my responses were good, especially for questions 2 and 3, but to me it is distinctly unappealing to write creatively from a character's point of view. Literature is interpretive, and different interpretations are valid, but writing a journal crystallizes the narrative and closes one off to other interpretations. I think I answered the five questions well for each entry.
